# pdf-viewer





A very simple aurelia wrapper around pdf.js

It assumes that you are providing `fileContents` as a base64string of the pdf from the backend.

Largely based on the example at https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/index.html#interactive-examples

## Building the code

```
yarn install

au run
```
